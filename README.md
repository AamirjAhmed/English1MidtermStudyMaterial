# English1MidtermStudyMaterial
# This repo is created to document and share a quick script I wrote to study for one of my English Midterms. It uses the Comand Line to quiz you about passages in the assinged reading. 
The Midterm requires you to say something significant about a given passage that must be identified, so this script was helpful in identifying cues for each reading. 

This is a super quick script but was very helpful when reviewing the material.
